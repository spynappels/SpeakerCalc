# SpeakerCalc

## Overview
A Python program to calculate Sound Pressure Levels at seat locations from PA Loudspeakers

## Pre-requisites
Python 3.4+ installed, with tkinter framework.
I've found that installing Thonny and using it to manage modules is easier for those who are not comfortable installing modules from the Command Line.

## Installation
Simply clone the repo to the required location, change to the SpeakerCalc directory and run speaker_calc.py:
`python3 speaker_calc.1.1.py`

Alternatively run it from within Thonny.

## Rationale
Currently this is limited to calculating dB-SPL from Evid 4.2 and Evid 6.2 speakers. If I have the need for additional speakers I shall include config files for them.
